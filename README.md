# Open3D Poisson reconstruction -- grid search

Based on this issue: 

https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/8214

and this discord discussion:

This is a quickly hacked together example of using rerun to view the results of grid search. This solution is not good in many ways, but maybe it can help inform proper support for grid search visualization  in rerun. 


# How to run

Install the pixi package manager (conda based): 

https://pixi.sh/v0.37.0/

```bash
pixi run bench
```
